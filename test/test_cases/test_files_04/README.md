In this folder we have test files for test case 04.

Make sure that the first 2 lines are like this:

```PlantUML
' alias = "HelloMyFriend"
' expected_result = ("hello my friend", "component", ["block", "weird"])
```
Take these over and adopt them to the test file:

Where "hello my friend" is the name of the element, 
"component" is the type, "block" is a stereotype. There can be more than 
one stereotype.
